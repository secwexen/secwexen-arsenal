## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Private Security Reports  

You can submit a **private security report directly through GitHub**.

GitHub supports confidential vulnerability reporting via:

**Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability**

This method:
- Keeps the report private  
- Notifies maintainers securely  
- Allows discussion without exposing details publicly   

We strongly recommend using this option for sensitive findings.

---

## Responsible Use
The toolkit must only be used for:

- Authorized penetration testing  
- Security research  
- Educational purposes  
- Defensive and offensive security training  
- OSINT and network analysis within legal boundaries  

Any use outside these boundaries is strictly prohibited.

---

## What We Do Not Accept
Contributions or modules involving:

- Malware  
- Exploits targeting unpatched systems  
- Unauthorized access tools  
- Ransomware, botnets, or DDoS utilities  
- Payloads intended for illegal activity  

Such submissions will be rejected immediately.

---

## Security Improvements
If you want to contribute to improving security:

- Add safer defaults  
- Improve validation and sanitization  
- Enhance logging and error handling  
- Strengthen defensive modules  
- Add detection or audit capabilities  

All improvements are welcome as long as they align with ethical guidelines.
