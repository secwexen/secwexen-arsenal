# Secwexen Architecture Overview

Secwexen is a modular security framework designed to provide offensive, defensive, OSINT, and automation capabilities in a clean, extensible, and maintainable structure.
This document explains the internal architecture, module layout, design principles, and interaction flow between components.

### 2.1 Directory Structure

```bash
secwexen-arsenal/
├── tools/
│   ├── offensive/           # Rust-based fast port scanner
│   ├── defensive/           # Python, Bash, PowerShell tools
│   ├── osint/               # Python OSINT tools
│   └── automation/          # Bash & PowerShell automation scripts
├── utils/                   # Shared helper modules
├── tests/                   # Pytest test suite
├── examples/                # Demo scripts
└── docs/                    # Documentation
```

### 2.2 Offensive Tools

```bash
tools/offensive/
- fast_port_scanner/ (Rust)
```

**Responsibilities:**

- Network scanning
- Service enumeration

**Design Principles:**

- Stateless, minimal external dependencies
- CLI-based, binary executable

> Note: There is no Python `port_scanner.py`. The correct tool is `fast_port_scanner`.

### 2.3 Defensive Tools

```bash
tools/defensive/
- bash/
- powershell/
- python/
```

**Responsibilities:**

- Log monitoring
- Firewall tracking
- Malware scanning

**Design Principles:**

- Lightweight and safe read-only operations
- Cross-platform support

---

### 2.4 OSINT Tools

```bash
tools/osint/python/
- email_harvester.py
- subdomain_finder.py
- username_lookup.py
```

**Responsibilities:**

- Subdomain enumeration
- Email harvesting
- Username footprinting

### 2.5 Automation Tools

```bash
tools/automation/
- bash/
- powershell/
```

**Responsibilities:**

- Backup
- Deployment
- Cleanup

**Design Principles:**

- Shell-first design
- Minimal configuration
- Reusable workflow components

### 2.6 Shared Utilities

```bash
utils/
- logger.py
- file_ops.py
- validators.py
```

**Purpose:** Provide consistent helper functions across all modules.

### 2.7 Examples

```bash
examples/
- osint_demo.py
- defensive_demo.py
- offensive_demo.py
- basic_usage.md
```

> `basic_usage.md` contains usage instructions and demonstration examples.

### 2.8 Testing

```bash
tests/
- test_core.py
- test_tools.py
- test_utils.py
```

**Principles:** Pytest-based, deterministic, isolated

### 2.9 Design Principles

- **Modularity** – each tool is isolated
- **Extensibility** – new tools can be added without modifying existing ones
- **Maintainability** – consistent naming and folder structure
- **Testability** – each module can be tested independently
- **Transparency** – clear documentation and predictable behavior

### 2.10 Notes

- Run commands are **not included here**; see `docs/basic_usage.md` for usage instructions.
- This Architecture Overview focuses on **modular structure and responsibilities** only.
