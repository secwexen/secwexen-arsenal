## About

**Secwexen Arsenal** is a comprehensive collection of offensive, defensive, and automation tools built for cybersecurity research, penetration testing, digital forensics, and threat analysis. The project brings together multi‑language utilities—written in **Python**, **Rust**, **Bash**, and **PowerShell**—designed to support real‑world workflows across Red Team, Blue Team, and OSINT operations.

The goal of this repository is to provide a unified, well‑structured toolkit that enhances productivity, accelerates analysis, and enables repeatable, controlled experimentation in secure environments. Every tool is built with a focus on clarity, performance, and practical applicability.

## Features

- Offensive security scripts for recon, enumeration, and exploitation  
- Defensive utilities for log analysis, threat hunting, and incident response  
- OSINT automation tools for intelligence gathering  
- Rust-based CLI tools for performance-critical tasks  
- Bash & PowerShell helpers for system diagnostics and workflow optimization
